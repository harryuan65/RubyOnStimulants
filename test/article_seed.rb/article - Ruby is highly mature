Ruby is highly mature.
Maturity means that the Ruby code is now more stable and refined, and Web Applications written on Ruby are much more maintainable.

Good developers know that code need not be written in the hottest new framework if it becomes a pain to support for the coming years. Instead, code stability that comes with maturity directly translates to saved time, which can then be used to focus on improving the application logic-or playing more foosball. A winner all around.

In other words, Mature Ruby Code > Code in Hot New Framework.

Ruby on Rails is open-source.
What does an open-source framework mean to the end-user? Well, for starters, the source code is free to download for anyone wishing to play around with Ruby.

The RoR framework runs on Linux, which is also 100% free and is an open-source framework.

Ruby gems, which lets you add features quickly without having to develop them from scratch, also comes in handy here. The developer’s time and effort is saved, which also translates to saved costs.

Ruby on Rails is easy to maintain and change.
One aspect of Ruby on Rails that all developers love irrespective of their other differences is the “Convention over Configuration” principle.
